## Search Syntax

`skim` borrowed `fzf`'s syntax for matching items:

| Token    | Match type                 | Description                       |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `text`   | fuzzy-match                | items that match `text`           |
| `^music` | prefix-exact-match         | items that start with `music`     |
| `.mp3$`  | suffix-exact-match         | items that end with `.mp3`        |
| `'wild`  | exact-match (quoted)       | items that include `wild`         |
| `!fire`  | inverse-exact-match        | items that do not include `fire`  |
| `!.mp3$` | inverse-suffix-exact-match | items that do not end with `.mp3` |

`skim` also supports the combination of tokens.

- Whitespace has the meaning of `AND`. With the term `src main`, `skim` will search
    for items that match **both** `src` and `main`.
- ` | ` means `OR` (note the spaces around `|`). With the term `.md$ |
    .markdown$`, `skim` will search for items ends with either `.md` or
    `.markdown`.
- `OR` has higher precedence. So `readme .md$ | .markdown$` is grouped into
    `readme AND (.md$ OR .markdown$)`.

In case that you want to use regular expressions, `skim` provides `regex` mode:

```sh
sk --regex
```

You can switch to `regex` mode dynamically by pressing `Ctrl-R` (Rotate Mode).
